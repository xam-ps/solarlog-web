Providing solarlog monitoring data on a website

This script parses data that is uploaded from a solarlog monitoring unit via FTP to a server to have the data accessible via the internet. The data is uploaded as .csv files. At this location there are 4 inverters, that's why the table shows 6 columns in total (date, inverter 1-4, total).
